This is the result of factors including discrimination in the workplace, career gender stereotypes and disproportionate caring responsibilities. The outbreak of Covid-19 has exacerbated this issue, with many women disproportionately impacted by the pandemic.\n \nNot only do women face unequal treatment in the workplace, but they also carry the brunt of domestic/care work at home. This campaign aims to raise awareness about economic injustice for women by driving institutional change and breaking down gender stereotypes regarding domestic/care work.",

This is the result of factors including discrimination in the workplace, career gender stereotypes and disproportionate caring responsibilities. The outbreak of Covid-19 has exacerbated this issue, with many women disproportionately impacted by the pandemic.\n \nNot only do women face unequal treatment in the workplace, but they also carry the brunt of domestic/care work at home. Prior to Covid, in the UK, women spent 1.8 times more time on unpaid care work and chores than men. Globally, the average is a lot higher with women doing 3 times as much unpaid work than men. Balancing unpaid and paid care can have significant impacts on their mental and physical wellbeing, as well as the wellbeing of others. Unpaid care work is significantly undervalued compared to paid work outside of the home. This is problematic as the majority of this work is undertaken by women, making its devaluation tied to the devaluation of women’s social position.\n \nThis campaign aims to raise awareness about economic injustice for women by driving institutional change, breaking down gender stereotypes regarding domestic/care work and strengthening the capacity of organisations working on this issue.\n",
