## Welcome! :wave:

This is the official repository for the now-u app. now-u is a non-profit started by James and Lizzie Elgar, aimed at driving positive change through coordinated monthly campaigns and actions. Volunteers from all over the world contributed to now-u, and are continuing to do so today, from app and web development, through designing and marketing. If you are reading this, there is a possibility you are a volunteer who has just been onboarded onto the team, and if this is the case, keep on reading! If not we appricate any contributions and are always looking for new members of the team so please don't hesitate to reach out.
